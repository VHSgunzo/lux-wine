# **Lux Wine**
This project allows you to easily run your favorite applications and games for Windows on almost any Linux x86_64 distribution using a specially configured Wine/Proton and [RunImage](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/runimage) container. Lux Wine also comes with a native Steam, which allows you not to think about installing a large number of libraries into your system (especially 32-bit ones) for its work.

## Requirements:

* Supported architectures `x86_64`
* The minimum recommended `Linux kernel` version is `4.18+` with support for `user namespaces`, but `5.0+` would be better
* `FUSE` (but not necessarily, because it is possible to work in unpacked form without `FUSE` mounting)
* The driver for the video card in your system
* Some kind of desktop environment

## **Installation**:
```
curl -sL lwrap.github.io|bash
```
* HF mirror:
```
curl -sL lux-wine-git.hf.space|bash
```

* or with `wget`:
```
wget -qO - lwrap.github.io|bash
```
* HF mirror:
```
wget -qO - lux-wine-git.hf.space|bash
```

## **Offline installation**:
1. Download latest `lwrun` release from the [**releases**](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/lwrun) page ([HF mirror](https://huggingface.co/lux-wine/lwrun/tree/main/releases))
2. Make it executable before run
3. For Nvidia users with a proprietary driver, it is also necessary to download or manually create an [image of the driver](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/runimage-nvidia-drivers) of the corresponding version and put it next to the `lwrun` container
4. Launch the `lwrun` container, the installation will be completely automatic

## **Terminal usage**:
```
